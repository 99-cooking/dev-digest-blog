## 🔥 HOT RELEASES

**Claude Sonnet 4.6**
Anthropic's most capable Sonnet yet. Full upgrade across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, and agent planning. 1M token context window in beta. Same pricing as Sonnet 4.5 ($3/$15 per million tokens). Approaches Opus-level intelligence — early access devs often preferred it over Opus 4.5. Now default on claude.ai and rolling out in GitHub Copilot.

## 💡 TECHNIQUES & IDEAS

**Nx: "We Deleted Most of Our MCP Tools"**
Nx DevTools published a blog post explaining why they dropped most MCP tools in favor of "Skills" — structured knowledge files that agents can reason about, reserving MCP only for connectivity. Their benchmarks show it's more efficient. Interesting counterpoint to the MCP-everything trend.

**Claude Code Agent Teams — Multi-Agent Coordination**
Enable multiple Claude Code sessions working in parallel. They coordinate through shared tasks and message each other. Not new but gaining serious traction — enable via settings.json. @dani_avila7 has the setup instructions.

**The 2026 Full-Stack Dev Stack**
@oscabriel's viral take: TypeScript + tsgo, React, TanStack, Convex backend, Cloudflare infra, Bun. Sparked a lot of debate.

## 🔮 EMERGING TRENDS

**Skills > MCP for Agent Knowledge**
Nx's blog post crystallizes something many are noticing: giving agents structured knowledge files ("skills") is often more effective than spinning up MCP servers. MCP is great for tool connectivity, but overfitting every interaction to tool calls adds latency and complexity. This "skills-first" approach aligns with how Claude Code's own CLAUDE.md works.

**Sonnet-Class Models Eating Opus's Lunch**
Claude Sonnet 4.6 approaching Opus-level performance at Sonnet pricing is a pattern we've seen accelerating. The capability gap between model tiers is shrinking fast. For most coding tasks, the mid-tier model is becoming "good enough" — save Opus for the truly hard stuff.

**AI Coworkers with Memory**
Rowboat (6.2K stars, trending) and similar projects show growing demand for AI tools that remember context across sessions. Local-first, knowledge-graph-based approaches are winning over cloud-dependent alternatives. The fact that Rowboat runs entirely locally with Markdown files is very much the zeitgeist.

**Starknet's Technical Moat**
Cairo's verification capabilities continue to set Starknet apart technically. @AbdelStark's take that "the future of Ethereum's execution engine is what Cairo is today" gained traction this week. AVNU Portal and other L2 infrastructure building momentum.
