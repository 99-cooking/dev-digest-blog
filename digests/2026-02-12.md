## 🔥 HOT RELEASES

**Entire — Developer Platform for Agentic Coding**
Former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke launched Entire with a massive $60M seed round ($300M valuation). It's a new open-source platform built for teams managing fleets of AI coding agents. First release is "Checkpoints" — a CLI that captures full agent reasoning, prompts & context directly in Git. The pitch: "If you build with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex — you will have a home with us."

**GPT-5.3-Codex on GitHub Copilot**
OpenAI's latest agentic coding model is now generally available on GitHub Copilot (and Cursor). Claims 25% faster performance for agentic tasks and stronger long-running, tool-driven workflows. Note: GitHub paused rollout temporarily to focus on platform reliability — so expect hiccups.
🔗 Changelog: https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-09-gpt-5-3-codex-is-now-generally-available-for-github-copilot/

**Anthropic: Advanced Tool Use Engineering Deep-Dive**
New engineering blog post on advanced tool use patterns with Claude. The post that kicked off discussion about agentic vision — Gemini pushing similar patterns too. The trend: agents completing ~20 actions autonomously before needing human input (double from 6 months ago).

## 🧪 INTERESTING REPOS

**claude-mem**
Persistent memory layer for Claude Code. Auto-captures everything Claude does during sessions, compresses with AI, injects context into future sessions. Hit ~24K stars in 3 days — one of the fastest-growing GitHub projects ever. Memory infrastructure is clearly the hottest problem in agent dev right now.
💻 GitHub: https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem

**Heretic**
Fully automated censorship removal for language models. Trending on GitHub since Feb 9. Already being used to create uncensored variants of models like Qwen3 4B. Controversial but technically interesting approach to fine-tuning.
💻 GitHub: https://github.com/p-e-w/heretic

**Chrome DevTools MCP**
Official Chrome DevTools integration for AI coding agents via MCP (Model Context Protocol). 23.5K stars. Lets your AI agent debug web apps through Chrome DevTools. Works with Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code.
💻 GitHub: https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp

**DeepSeek-OCR-2**
DeepSeek's advanced OCR model. Handles complex visual documents, layouts, and reading order far better than traditional OCR. Getting traction for feeding documents into LLM/agent workflows. Docker one-liner deployment available.

## 💡 TECHNIQUES & IDEAS

**Vibe-Coded Apps: 21 Things AI Agents Usually Forget**
Practical checklist of what breaks when you let AI agents build your app — auth, error handling, rate limiting, proper logging, DB migrations, etc. Good reality check for the "idea to app in a weekend" crowd.

**The AI Coding Gap: Seniors Get Faster, Juniors Spin Their Wheels**
ZDNET piece based on new data: ~1/3 of code is now AI-generated, dev productivity up 4% overall — but the gains are heavily skewed toward senior devs who know what to ask for. Junior devs actually slower in some cases.

**Aha! Develop + AI Agent Integration**
Interesting pattern: project management tool now integrates directly with Copilot, Cursor, and Claude. Type your PM ticket, agent picks it up. The "AI coding agent as team member" workflow is going mainstream.

## 🔮 EMERGING TRENDS

**Agent Fleet Management is the New DevOps**
Entire's $60M bet, plus Anthropic's agentic coding report, both point the same direction: the future dev manages *fleets of agents*, not individual tools. The platform layer (coordinating multiple agents, maintaining context, tracking reasoning) is where the value is shifting.

**Memory Infrastructure Explosion**
claude-mem's 24K-star sprint, plus projects like cognee and claude-memory, signal that persistent agent memory is THE unsolved problem everyone wants cracked. Expect a Cambrian explosion of memory solutions (vector, graph, SQLite, markdown — everyone's trying something).

**"Repository Intelligence" Goes Mainstream**
Per Anthropic's 2026 trends report: agents now understand repo context, commit history, and architectural patterns — not just individual files. This "repository intelligence" is what makes 20-action autonomous loops possible.

**Patch Tuesday Reminder: 6 Active Zero-Days**
Not a trend, but worth knowing: Microsoft patched 59 vulns including 6 actively exploited zero-days (including an MSHTML framework bypass). Patch your stuff.
