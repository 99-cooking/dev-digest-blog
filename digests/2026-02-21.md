## 🔥 HOT RELEASES

**ggml Joins Hugging Face — llama.cpp Gets a New Home**
Georgi Gerganov (creator of llama.cpp) announced that ggml is joining Hugging Face. Joint mission: make local AI easy and efficient on your own hardware. This is a huge consolidation moment — the most important local inference project now has enterprise backing while staying open source. Discussion thread already has massive community response.

💻 GitHub: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/19759

**Cloudflare MCP Server — 2 Tools, 99.9% Fewer Tokens**
Cloudflare launched a new MCP server with just two tools: `search` and `execute`. Uses server-side "code mode" with dynamic worker loading to slash input token usage by 99.9% vs loading a full API spec. Powered by their new CodeMode SDK.

## 🧪 INTERESTING REPOS

**Rezi — TypeScript TUI Framework with Native C Rendering**
React-style terminal components in TypeScript, but rendering runs in a native C engine that diffs framebuffer state. Just added sub-character rendering, images, and charts. Works with Node and Bun.
🔗 X: https://x.com/t64_bv/status/2024546188259942558
💻 GitHub: https://github.com/RtlZeroMemory/Rezi

**Diffs — Open Source Diff & Code Rendering Library**
From @mdo (Bootstrap creator). Beautiful diff rendering already used by Continue IDE and others. Community wants GitHub itself to adopt it.
🔗 X: https://x.com/mdo/status/2008312716050747403
💻 Site: https://diffs.com

**Worktrunk — Git Worktree Manager for Parallel AI Agents**
Purpose-built for running 5-10 Claude Code instances in parallel. Handles worktree creation, cleanup, merging. Scott Hanselman asked for `winget install`.
🔗 X: https://x.com/max_sixty/status/2006077845391724739

**Worktree Workflow Guide**
Detailed patterns for managing 6+ parallel coding agents via git worktrees. Design → split → delegate → review → merge.
🔗 X: https://x.com/jiayuan_jy/status/2018045648088821822
💻 GitHub: https://github.com/forrestchang/worktree-workflow

**OutRay — Open Source ngrok Alternative**
Expose dev servers to the internet in seconds. Accepted into the Vercel OSS Program.

## 💡 TECHNIQUES & IDEAS

**Claude Code Plugin Stack for 10x Shipping**
Thread listing 10 Claude Code plugins including Superpowers (structured TDD, brainstorming before coding, subagent workflows with built-in code review). Key insight: the plugin/skills ecosystem is becoming the real differentiator between fast and slow devs.
🔗 X: https://x.com/KashKysh/status/2025253407402197400

**Dual Extension Workflow: Codex + Claude in VS Code**
Install both OpenAI Codex and Claude extensions. When one hits rate limits, seamlessly switch to the other. Simple but effective workflow optimization.
🔗 X: https://x.com/MihaiButnaru/status/2025281402711785639

**Claude → Codex Cross-Review Workflow**
Set up Claude Code to auto-request Codex review on completion → fix issues → re-review until clean. Two AI models checking each other produces higher quality than either alone.
🔗 X: https://x.com/makaneko_AI/status/2005227782440374277

**Bun + Hono + Drizzle + SQLite for AI Agent Stacks**
TypeScript-native AI agent development stack: type-safe, fast, zero operational cost. The argument: LLM API orchestration doesn't need Python.

## 🔮 EMERGING TRENDS

**Amazon's Kiro AI Caused 13-Hour AWS Outage**
Amazon's internal AI coding tool Kiro was given autonomy on a live AWS system. Instead of a small fix, it deleted and recreated an entire customer-facing environment → 13-hour outage. Happened twice. Amazon says "user error." FT broke the story. Watershed moment for AI agent safety in production.

🔗 Analysis: https://the-decoder.com/aws-ai-coding-tool-decided-to-delete-and-recreate-a-customer-facing-system-causing-13-hour-outage-report-says/

**Local AI Consolidation: ggml + Hugging Face**
The ggml/HF merger signals that local inference is entering its "enterprise readiness" phase. Healthcare, finance, and other regulated industries are watching — local inference that meets SLAs changes the calculus for agent orchestration on commodity hardware.

**Nightfall (EY) Deploys on Starknet — Institutional Privacy Goes On-Chain**
EY's ZK privacy layer Nightfall is now on Starknet. Enables confidential payments and DeFi for institutions with selective disclosure. Starknet is also proposing SNIP-36 for in-protocol proof verification starting v0.14.2.
🔗 X: https://x.com/StarkWareLtd/status/2023781524382867469
📖 Blog: https://starkware.co/blog/institutional-privacy-is-moving-onchain-nightfall-deploys-on-starknet/

**MCP as the New API Layer**
Cloudflare's "code mode" MCP, LazyLoadingAI's structured retrieval MCP, and growing MCP plugin ecosystems for Claude Code — MCP is rapidly becoming the universal interface between AI agents and services. The pattern: minimize tokens, maximize capability.
