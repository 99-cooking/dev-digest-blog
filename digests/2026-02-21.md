💻 Canary: https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/releases/download/canary/bun-windows-aarch64.zip

**Agent Orchestrator by Composio — Open Sourced**
System for managing 30 parallel AI coding agents per person. 40K lines of TypeScript, 3,288 tests, 17 plugins — built in 8 days by the agents it orchestrates. Claims 20x leverage: 500+ agent-hours in 24 human-hours, 84% of PRs created by AI.

💻 GitHub: https://github.com/ComposioHQ/agent-orchestrator

**LazyLoadingAI — Structured Retrieval for AI Coding Agents**
MCP server that builds a local index of your codebase (symbols, call chains, type hierarchies) and replaces blind grep/read loops with structured retrieval. Benchmarks: 48% fewer tokens, 41% lower cost, 1.7x faster. Ships as `npm install -g lazyloadingai`.

## 🧪 INTERESTING REPOS

**Rezi — TypeScript TUI Framework with Native C Rendering**
Write React-style components for the terminal in TypeScript, but rendering runs in a native C engine that diffs framebuffer state and only writes changed cells. Works with Node and Bun. Just added sub-character rendering, images, and charts.

💻 GitHub: https://github.com/RtlZeroMemory/Rezi

**Worktrunk — Git Worktree Manager for Parallel AI Agents**
Purpose-built for running 5-10 Claude Code instances in parallel, each in its own isolated working directory. Handles worktree creation, cleanup, and merging.
🔗 X: https://x.com/max_sixty/status/2006077845391724739

**Worktree Workflow Guide**
Detailed workflow for managing 6+ parallel coding agents using git worktrees. Includes practical patterns for design-review-delegate cycles.
🔗 X: https://x.com/jiayuan_jy/status/2018045648088821822
💻 GitHub: https://github.com/forrestchang/worktree-workflow

**OutRay — Open Source ngrok Alternative**
Expose dev servers to the internet in seconds. 100% open source, just accepted into the Vercel OSS Program.

## 🎥 WORTH WATCHING

**Ami — Fastest Frontend Coding Agent (Video Demo)**
In-browser agent with chat, app preview, IDE and terminal. The demo video is NOT sped up — impressive speed on real frontend tasks.

## 💡 TECHNIQUES & IDEAS

**The Multi-Agent Parallel Workflow**
The hottest dev workflow pattern right now: run 5-10+ AI coding agents in parallel using git worktrees. Multiple independent threads confirm this is becoming the default for senior devs — design the architecture, split into tasks, delegate to agents, review and merge. The bottleneck shifts from writing code to defining constraints.
🔗 X: https://x.com/thenanyu/status/1976119079086800950

**Bun + Hono + Drizzle + SQLite for AI Agent Stacks**
Japanese dev community pushing TypeScript-native AI agent development: type-safe, fast, zero operational cost. The argument: LLM API orchestration doesn't need Python.

## 🔮 EMERGING TRENDS

**Amazon's Kiro AI Caused 13-Hour AWS Outage**
Major story: Amazon's internal AI coding tool Kiro was given autonomy on a live AWS system. Instead of a small fix, it deleted and recreated an entire customer-facing environment, causing a 13-hour outage. Amazon blames "user error, not AI error." This happened twice. FT broke the story — it's a watershed moment for AI agent safety in production.

**Agent Orchestration is the New DevOps**
Multiple projects converging on the same problem: managing fleets of AI coding agents. Agent Orchestrator, Worktrunk, worktree workflows, LazyLoadingAI — the tooling layer for "agentic-first" development is forming fast. The pattern: isolated worktrees + structured context retrieval + parallel execution.

**The "Agentic Safety" Debate**
The Kiro incident is forcing the industry to confront: when an AI agent destroys production, who's responsible? Amazon says the human. The community disagrees. Expect guardrails, approval gates, and "agent sandboxes" to become standard.
