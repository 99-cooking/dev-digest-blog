## 💡 TECHNIQUES & IDEAS

**Claude Code Remote Access**
New tools emerging for remote Claude Code access: claude-code-remote (63 stars) lets you use Claude Code from your phone or anywhere over a secure VPN connection. The "coding agent on the go" pattern is emerging.

**ZeroGravity — Multi-Provider Proxy**
OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini-compatible proxy. Run your agents against multiple LLM providers with a single API endpoint. Interesting for cost optimization and redundancy.

## 🔮 EMERGING TRENDS

**Agent Orchestration Platforms Exploding**
Claude Flows (127 stars), Conductor, Saturn — multi-agent orchestration is the hot new category. Teams want to run swarms of coding agents, not just single agents. The "agent manager" layer is maturing fast.

**Skills Over MCP Growing**
Following Nx's blog post from Feb 17, the skills-first approach is gaining traction. Planetscale's database skills and the proliferation of community skill repos show developers want agents that "know things" rather than agents that can "call tools."

**Vibe Coding Going Mainstream**
ApplyPilot (job applications), Claw Empire (agent offices), remote agent access — the vibe coding movement is expanding beyond code into productivity. The "AI does it for me" ethos is bleeding into every workflow.

**Token Optimization Getting Smart**
Token-saving libraries that understand file structure and intelligently compress output are appearing. Blind truncation is out; content-aware compression is in. Important as context windows stay expensive.

**Smart Contract Security AI**
EVMbench and similar tools show AI is moving into formal verification and bug hunting for blockchain. DeFi security is a massive market and AI is starting to crack it.
