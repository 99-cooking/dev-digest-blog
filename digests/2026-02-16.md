## 🔥 HOT RELEASES

**TypeScript 6.0 Beta — The Last JavaScript-Based TypeScript**
The final JS-based TypeScript is here. TS 6.0 is a transition release — deprecated options will be removed in TypeScript 7.0, which will be the **native Go-based compiler rewrite**. New features include smarter type inference, `es2025` target/lib, Temporal types, `#/` subpath imports, and `--stableTypeOrdering`. RC due Feb 24, stable March 17.

**ByteDance Doubao 2.0 — Agent-Era AI Model**
ByteDance released Doubao-Seed-2.0, positioning it for the "agent era" — autonomous task execution, not just Q&A. The Pro variant benchmarks against GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro at **90% lower cost**. Doubao leads China with 155M weekly active users vs DeepSeek's 81.6M.

**Entire — Ex-GitHub CEO's $60M AI Dev Platform**
Thomas Dohmke (former GitHub CEO) launched **Entire**, a developer platform for agentic coding, with a record $60M seed round at $300M valuation. Designed for a world where most code is written by AI agents, with humans managing and reviewing.

## 🧪 INTERESTING REPOS

**Gas Town — Kubernetes for AI Coding Agents**
Steve Yegge's open-source orchestration system that coordinates 20-30 Claude Code instances working in parallel on the same codebase. Architecture mirrors K8s: Mayor (control plane), Polecats (ephemeral workers), Refinery (merge queue), all backed by Git via "Beads" issue tracking. Featured on Pragmatic Engineer, SE Daily, and TWiT this week.

## 💡 TECHNIQUES & IDEAS

**Risks of AI-Assisted Development**
Thoughtful post arguing: review AI-generated code *harder* than human code, write code by hand regularly, and make sure fundamentals come before delegation. Code cloning has surged 4x with AI copying similar blocks instead of creating reusable logic.

**TanStack Start vs Next.js**
Deep comparison making the rounds — TanStack Start is now a serious Next.js competitor with full deployment freedom (Node, Deno, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, any VPS). Vite-powered, no vendor lock-in.

**The $1.5B AI Dev Startup That Was Actually 700 Engineers**
Cautionary tale: a startup marketing "fully autonomous AI development tools" was actually relying on 700 human engineers in India doing the work manually. Median dev salaries dipped 9% YoY but driven more by layoff oversupply than actual AI replacement.

## 🔮 EMERGING TRENDS

**Multi-Agent Orchestration Is the New Frontier**
Gas Town, Entire, and the broader wave signal that the bottleneck is shifting from "can AI code?" to "how do you manage 20+ AI agents coding simultaneously?" Merge conflict resolution, context window management, and durable workflows are the new infra problems.

**TypeScript Is #1 on GitHub (Officially)**
GitHub's latest Octoverse report confirms TypeScript overtook all other languages in August 2025. 6 of 10 fastest-growing projects by contributors were AI infrastructure/tooling. The TS → Go compiler rewrite in 7.0 will be the biggest runtime story of 2026.

**The Agent Platform Gold Rush**
Entire ($60M), Gas Town (open source), OpenAI Codex (autonomous), Claude Code (parallel agents) — everyone is racing to build the "GitHub for agents." The developer platform layer above AI models is where the value capture battle is happening.
