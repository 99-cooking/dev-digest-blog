## 🔥 HOT RELEASES

**MiniMax M2.5 — Open Source**
The 229B parameter MoE model (~10B active at inference) is now fully open-sourced. Claims near-Opus 4.6 performance at 95% lower cost. However, the new SWE-rebench benchmark tells a different story — read the Trends section below.

💻 HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.5

**Cline CLI 2.0**
The popular VS Code AI coding extension (5M+ devs) now has a full terminal CLI. Parallel agents, CI/CD pipeline support, works with any editor via ACP protocol. Ships with free access to MiniMax M2.5 and Kimi K2.5.
🔗 X: https://x.com/dr_cintas/status/2022387444189139367
💻 Install: `npm install -g cline`
🌐 Site: https://cline.bot/cli

**Qwen3-Coder-Next**
Alibaba's new coding model — 80B total params but only 3B active (MoE). Showing 40%+ on SWE-rebench, competitive with much larger models. People are running it locally on mini PCs with 96GB RAM.

## 💡 TECHNIQUES & IDEAS

**Spotify Engineers Run Claude Code During Morning Standup**
Engineers request bug fixes and features during meetings. By the time they sit down at their desk, the changes are merged to production. The "meeting-driven development" era.

**Desktop Apps in Pure Rust with Claude Code**
Just describe the digital art/design tool you want and Claude Code generates a pure Rust desktop app. No Electron, no web stack.

## 🔮 EMERGING TRENDS

**SWE-rebench Exposes Benchmark Overfitting**
The biggest story in AI evals this week. SWE-rebench uses fresh, never-seen-before problems. Results: models that scored 80% on original SWE-bench dropped to ~39% on rebench. Claude Opus 4.6 hit 52% — biggest gap between claimed and real performance for Chinese models. The era of "training to the test" is getting called out.

**The Chinese Model Wave**
Five labs dropped models this week for Lunar New Year: GLM-5, MiniMax M2.5, Doubao 2.0, Qwen 3.5, Kimi K2.5. All open-weight or open-source, all free or near-free. The commoditization of AI coding is accelerating fast.
🔗 X: https://x.com/aakashgupta/status/2022544431245910487

**Terminal-First AI Coding**
The shift from IDE extensions to terminal-native AI agents continues. Cline CLI 2.0, Claude Code improvements, pi's WebSocket transport — the command line is becoming the primary AI coding interface. Parallel agents in terminal workflows are the new normal.

**"Zero Human Company" Experiments**
People are literally running entire dev workflows with 16+ AI "CTOs" running open-source models. Still more performance art than production strategy, but the experiments are getting more serious.
