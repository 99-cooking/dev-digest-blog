## 🔥 HOT RELEASES

**Electrobun v1 — Desktop Apps with TypeScript + Bun + Zig**
Finally a lightweight Electron alternative that doesn't feel like Tauri-level complexity. Bun for the main process, webviews for UI, Zig for native bindings. ~12MB self-extracting bundles, updates as small as 14KB with bsdiff patches. Typed RPC between main and renderer. The sweet spot between Electron bloat and Tauri ceremony.

## 💡 TECHNIQUES & IDEAS

**Multi-Agent Orchestration: Opus Steering Codex Agents**
The pattern of using a "manager" model (Opus 4.6) to coordinate multiple "worker" agents (Codex 5.3) is maturing. @KingBootoshi's codex-orchestrator and @DionysianAgent running 12-16 agents at 95% autonomy through eigencode show this is production-ready, not just a demo.
🔗 X: https://x.com/KingBootoshi/status/2019564738649505882
🔗 X: https://x.com/DionysianAgent/status/1929337613292327231

**Agent Transcripts as PR Artifacts**
New pattern emerging: automatically attach agent transcripts to git commits and PRs for review. Lets teams audit what the AI actually did, building trust in agent-generated code.
🔗 X: https://x.com/indragie/status/2023806503711555802

**Cursor Tip: Auto-Structured PR Commits**
Before pushing a PR, ask the agent to break changes into a series of commits for easier review. Stack skills: /code-review → /simplify → commit breakdown.
🔗 X: https://x.com/leerob/status/2018456023145820461

**God-Tier Agentic Bug Fixing**
When debugging large codebases: send agents off to research & understand different parts of the codebase first, then combine findings. Agentic decomposition > single-shot prompting.
🔗 X: https://x.com/KingBootoshi/status/2018623546281673053

**Assign GitHub Issues Directly to Coding Agents**
PMs/designers find small changes → create issue → assign to coding agent. What used to be "too small to context-switch for" now gets done automatically.
🔗 X: https://x.com/thenanyu/status/1976119079086800950

**Building Custom Frameworks with AI**
@wongmjane built a Cloudflare Workers-native React framework streaming RSC with StyleX support, entirely using Opus 4.5. When the AI can build your custom framework, "stop fighting existing ones."

## 🔮 EMERGING TRENDS

**Multi-Agent Coding Goes Production**
Not just one agent — teams of agents. Codex-orchestrator, eigencode, OpenCode's Sandbox Agent SDK all point to the same future: a senior model orchestrating junior models across parallel tasks. The "AI team lead" pattern is here.

**Open-Source Model Blitz**
MiniMax M2.5, Kimi K2.5, Sarvam 30B/105B — all in the same week. The open-source frontier is getting crowded, costs are plummeting, and Opus-level performance at a fraction of the price is becoming table stakes.

**Agent Accountability & Auditability**
Agent transcripts attached to PRs, memory systems for persistent context (Claude-Mem), templates for consistent behavior (Claude Code Templates) — the ecosystem is building the governance layer that makes agents trustworthy teammates.

**Desktop App Renaissance via Bun**
Electrobun v1: TypeScript everywhere, tiny bundles, fast updates. The Electron → Tauri → Electrobun progression shows the JS desktop story isn't done evolving.

**Runtime Performance Wars Continue**
`lo` runtime at 1.75x faster than Bun, Node.js finding 25x gains from libuv patches — the JS runtime space still has massive performance wins hiding in plain sight.
