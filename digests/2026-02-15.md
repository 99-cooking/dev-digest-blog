## 💡 TECHNIQUES & IDEAS

**MCP Context Window Waste**
You're wasting 10-50% of your context window. Every MCP server injects its full tool schema into every message whether used or not. Chrome DevTools MCP alone = 18,600 tokens just sitting there. Solution: Claude Code already lazy-loads MCP tools. Enable `CLAUDE_CODE_TOOL_SEARCH=true` for other setups.
🔗 X: https://x.com/nikil/status/2022778699993764115

**AI Coding Cost Reality Check**
Reports that some AI coding editors are *doubling* total development costs — you pay for the human AND the AI, with no productivity gain. The discourse around AI coding has descended to "nutrition science" level — conflicting claims everywhere.

🔗 X: https://x.com/ChrisGPotts/status/2022847577297948762

**Solo Founder Stack 2026**
Daily stack from a solo founder: Claude (AI pair), Next.js + TypeScript, NeonDB + DrizzleORM, Vercel hosting. Lean and effective.
🔗 X: https://x.com/alexcloudstar/status/2023004513305600022

**Claude Code One-Shotting Full Design + Dev**
"Claude code one shotted this, design + dev. Designers are cooked?" — increasingly common pattern of AI handling both design and implementation in a single prompt.

## 🔮 EMERGING TRENDS

**MCP Everywhere** — GitHub, Google, Visual Studio all shipping MCP integrations this week. MCP is becoming the universal plugin standard for AI coding tools. But context window bloat is a real problem that needs lazy loading solutions.

**$10 AI Hardware** — PicoClaw proves you can run a capable AI agent on dirt-cheap RISC-V hardware. The "edge AI" movement is getting serious.

**AI Coding Backlash Forming** — Multiple threads questioning whether AI coding tools actually save money or just shift costs. The honeymoon phase may be ending for some teams.

**GitHub's "Eternal September"** — GitHub published a blog post on how the flood of AI-generated repos and PRs is affecting open source maintainers, and what they plan to do about it.
🔗 https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/welcome-to-the-eternal-september-of-open-source-heres-what-we-plan-to-do-for-maintainers/

**Starknet EVM Wallet Bridge** — EVM wallets now plug directly into Starknet's Earn portal, new WBTC vaults live, native staking rolling out. Starknet accessibility expanding.
