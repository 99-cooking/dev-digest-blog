### 1. Pentagon Threatens to Blacklist Anthropic Over Ethics Standoff
The DoD is considering labeling Anthropic a "supply chain risk" after the company refused to allow Claude to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or autonomous weapons without human oversight. Anthropic is currently the only AI company deployed on classified Pentagon networks. Palantir is caught in the middle as a key contractor using Claude. This sets a major precedent for AI ethics vs. national security.
